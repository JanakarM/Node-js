# Node-js
## http-server
### Simple app to start a web server and listen to requests.
### I made this to receive some data from other websites using my app url as redirect_uri.
#### That is, I would initiate a request to site_a which will take me to its Authentication flow and after its successfull, I will get the requested data in my app (site_a will send the data to the endpoint I provided initially while making request).
